# CIS550-Final-Project-Group-27

In this project, we will help tourists explore food and attractions in tandem. After a meal, if a tourist wants to explore lesser known attractions nearby, our site can generate a list of suggestions based on the restaurant's location. If a tourist is interested in restaurant suggestions after visiting an attraction, our site can provide this information too.

We take data from Yelp for food, and from MyGeoData for attractions.

The queries folder stores the queries we will execute, and the preprocessing folder stores our data preprocessing.
